3. Outputs (such as statistics, tables and graphs) obtained from analysis of these data may be further disseminated provided that I: (a) acknowledge both the original depositors and the Australian Data Archive; (b) acknowledge another archive where the data file is made available through the Australian Data Archive by another archive; and (c) declare that those who carried out the original analysis and collection of the data bear no responsibility for the further analysis or interpretation of it. 

4. Use of the material is solely at my risk and I indemnify the Australian Data Archive and its host institution, The Australian National University.
